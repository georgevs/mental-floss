https://leetcode.com/problems/connecting-cities-with-minimum-cost/

There are n cities labeled from 1 to n. 
You are given the integer `n` and an array `connections` 
where connections[i] = [xi, yi, costi] indicates that the cost of connecting 
city xi and city yi (bidirectional connection) is costi.

Return the minimum cost to connect all the n cities 
such that there is at least one path between each pair of cities. 
If it is impossible to connect all the n cities, return -1,

The cost is the sum of the connections' costs used.
