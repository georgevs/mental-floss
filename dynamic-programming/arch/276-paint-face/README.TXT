https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-fence/

You are painting a fence of n posts with k different colors. 
You must paint the posts following these rules:

Every post must be painted exactly one color.
There cannot be three or more consecutive posts with the same color.

Given the two integers n and k, 
return the number of ways you can paint the fence.

Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: All the possibilities are shown.
Note that painting all the posts red or all the posts green is invalid
because there cannot be three posts in a row with the same color.

Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 1

Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 42
