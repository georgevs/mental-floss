You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, 
and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. 
You may complete as many transactions as you like, 
but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously 
(i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
