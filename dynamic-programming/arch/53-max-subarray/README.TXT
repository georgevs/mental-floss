Kadane's Algorithm

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) 
which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.


Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
